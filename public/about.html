<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Kritin and ,im a 16-year-old student from Chennai, India, with a deep passion for both sports and technology.
  Growing up in a vibrant city like Chennai, 
  I’ve been lucky to experience a mix of cultural richness and modernity, 
  which has shaped my interests and aspirations.</p>

<p>Football is more than just a hobby for me;
  it’s a significant part of my life. From the moment I first kicked a ball, 
  I knew this sport was something I wanted to pursue seriously.
  I spend a lot of my time on the field, honing my skills, improving my technique, and building my physical fitness. 
  My dream is to join a competitive football team where I can challenge myself, 
  grow as an athlete, and possibly even play at a professional level one day. 
  I admire how football demands not only physical prowess but also mental sharpness and teamwork. 
  It’s a sport that teaches discipline, strategic thinking, 
  and perseverance—qualities that I try to apply in all areas of my life.</p>
